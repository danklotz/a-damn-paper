# Technical Note: The Divide and Measure Nonconformity

This repository contains the code that is required to reproduce the experiment for the Technical Note "The Divide and Measure Nonconformity" by Klotz et al. (in review).

Note that the computation part is written in python, while the plots are made with R. Furhter, the code assumes that [neural hydrology](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology) and other libraries are installed.

As long as the review process thakes place we will update the repository as the review as required. We will also add links to the required data later, to make the reproduction less combersome. Aftrer the peer-review the repository will be frozen and we will fix the dependencies then accodringly.
